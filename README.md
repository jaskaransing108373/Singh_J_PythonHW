# Hot water Ice Fire in Python!

Pick your power and play against the computer - you'll only get a virtual sting if you lose!

Prerequisites: All you need is Python3 to play.

Clone the project, navigate to the correct directory, - cd directory name - and run the game.py file in a Python Terminal window for macOS/Linux.

The rules are the same as the classic game:
1. Hot water extinguishes Fire
2. Fire melts Ice
3. Ice colds Hot water

Choose your power wisely!

The computer chooses first; just follow the prompts.

Built with Python 3.
